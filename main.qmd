## Topics

- Converting `.dwg` to `.yaml`
- Outbreak early warning signals
- ML-based approaches to synthetic trajectory generation
- Framing the inference problem

## Topics

- Two parallel strands:
  - Uncertainty-aware identification of infection pathways
  - Identifying early-warning signals for infection outbreaks

## Floorplans

- Getting floorplans
- What do they look like?
- What do we want them to do?
- What do they currently do?
- How are we processing them?
- What do we still need to do?
- What are we doing about it?
